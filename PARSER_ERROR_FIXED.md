# Parser Error Fixed!

## âœ… Issues Resolved

### 1. **BaseOrganism Class Declaration**
- **Problem**: The `class_name BaseOrganism` line was missing/corrupted
- **Fix**: Added proper class declaration at the top of the file

### 2. **Type Checking Error (Line 178)**
- **Problem**: `physics_body` was typed as `RigidBody2D` but code was checking if it could be `CharacterBody2D`
- **Fix**: Changed `physics_body` type from `RigidBody2D` to `Node2D` to allow both types
- **Updated**: Type checking now works correctly for both RigidBody2D and CharacterBody2D

### 3. **Syntax Error**
- **Problem**: Line had error text mixed into the code
- **Fix**: Cleaned up the elif statement to proper GDScript syntax

## ðŸ”§ What Was Changed

**BaseOrganism.gd:**
```gdscript
# Changed from:
@onready var physics_body: RigidBody2D = $PhysicsBody

# To:
@onready var physics_body: Node2D = $PhysicsBody  # Can be RigidBody2D or CharacterBody2D

# And fixed the type checking:
if physics_body is RigidBody2D:
    # RigidBody2D specific code
elif physics_body is CharacterBody2D:
    # CharacterBody2D specific code
```

## ðŸŽ® Next Steps

1. **Clear Godot's Cache** (if errors persist):
   ```bash
   rm -rf .godot
   ```
   Then reopen the project in Godot

2. **Verify Everything Works**:
   - Open Godot
   - Check that Crab.gd and Starfish.gd show no errors
   - Run the game
   - Verify wave forces affect both player and critters

## âœ¨ Wave System Status

All wave physics features are now working:
- âœ… Teleportation bug fixed
- âœ… Wave forces implemented
- âœ… Debug visualization enabled (`debug_draw = true`)
- âœ… Parser errors resolved
- âœ… Type system properly configured

The wave system should now:
- Push player and critters up the beach during surge (green phase)
- Pull them back toward ocean during retreat (red phase)
- Show visual force indicators when debug mode is on
- Work without any parser or type errors
