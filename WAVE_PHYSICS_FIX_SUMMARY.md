# Wave Physics System Fix Summary

## üöÄ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Teleportation Bug** ‚úÖ
   - **Root Cause**: WaveArea's `_physics_process` was duplicating collision detection with Area2D's built-in signals
   - **Fix**: Removed duplicate detection logic, let Area2D handle it naturally through signals
   - **Result**: No more player teleportation or position jumps

### 2. **Wave Force Implementation** ‚úÖ  
   - **Problem**: NO force system existed - detection without action
   - **Fix**: Added `_apply_forces_to_bodies()` method that:
     - Calculates forces based on wave phase (surge, retreat, pause, travel)
     - Applies depth-based dampening (stronger at surface)
     - Adds realistic sideways drift
     - Properly modifies player velocity and organism physics

### 3. **Force Properties Added** ‚úÖ
   - Added `surge_force` (300 pixels/sec) - pushes up beach
   - Added `retreat_force` (250 pixels/sec) - pulls to ocean
   - Configurable in WaveState resource

### 4. **Organism Wave Physics** ‚úÖ
   - Restored `apply_wave_force()` in BaseOrganism
   - Added size-based scaling (smaller critters affected more)
   - Proper freeze/unfreeze handling for RigidBody2D
   - Works with both RigidBody2D and CharacterBody2D

### 5. **Debug Visualization** ‚úÖ
   - Shows wave phase with color coding
   - Draws force vectors as arrows on affected bodies
   - Toggle with `debug_draw` property on WaveArea

## üéÆ Testing Instructions

1. **Enable Debug Mode**:
   - In the scene, find the WaveArea node
   - Set `debug_draw = true` to see force vectors
   - Set WaveDetector `debug_mode = false` to reduce console spam

2. **Test Player Forces**:
   - Stand at the shore line
   - Watch as waves push you up the beach (green phase)
   - Experience pull back toward ocean (red phase)
   - Notice sideways drift during pause (yellow phase)

3. **Test Critter Forces**:
   - Spawn some critters near the water
   - Watch them get pushed/pulled by waves
   - Smaller critters should move more than larger ones

4. **Verify No Teleportation**:
   - Walk in and out of waves repeatedly
   - Player should move smoothly without position jumps

## üìä Force Behavior by Phase

| Phase | Force Direction | Strength | Visual Color |
|-------|----------------|----------|--------------|
| **Surging** | Up beach (-Y) | 300 px/s | Green |
| **Retreating** | To ocean (+Y) | 250 px/s | Red |
| **Pausing** | None (holding) | 0 | Yellow |
| **Traveling** | Slight lift | 50 px/s | Blue |
| **Calm** | None | 0 | Gray |

## üîß Configuration

Adjust these values in WaveState resource:
- `surge_force`: How strong waves push up beach
- `retreat_force`: How strong waves pull back
- `edge_y`: Top of wave collision area
- `bottom_y`: Bottom of wave collision area

## üêõ Known Issues Remaining

1. **Force Scale**: Forces might need tuning for your specific game feel
2. **Organism Freezing**: Timer-based re-freezing could accumulate if waves hit rapidly
3. **Debug Prints**: Some debug prints remain but only show when debug flags are enabled

## üìù Code Changes Summary

- **WaveArea.gd**: Complete rewrite of physics process, added force application
- **WaveState.gd**: Added surge_force and retreat_force properties  
- **BaseOrganism.gd**: Restored and improved wave force handling
- **WaveDetector.gd**: Simplified, removed duplicate logic
- **PlayerController.gd**: Now properly receives velocity modifications from waves

## ‚ú® Next Steps

1. **Tune Forces**: Adjust surge_force and retreat_force for desired gameplay
2. **Add Particles**: Consider adding splash particles when entering/exiting waves
3. **Sound Effects**: Add whoosh sounds during surge/retreat phases
4. **Performance**: Consider object pooling if many critters are affected simultaneously
